# Security Best Practices for SuiSign

This document outlines the security measures implemented in SuiSign to ensure safe operation and protect users from potential threats.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- External resources limited to trusted domains only
- Inline scripts and styles restricted where possible

### 2. Secure External Links
- All external links include `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`
- Proper `aria-label` attributes for accessibility and security
- External links open in new tabs with security restrictions

### 3. Image Security
- Replaced external avatar services with secure local Avatar component
- Fallback avatars for failed image loads
- Content-Type validation for uploaded images

### 4. HTTP Security Headers
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME-type confusion
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Forces HTTPS connections
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

### 5. Asset Security
- Local serving of PDF.js assets instead of external CDNs
- Integrity checks for critical dependencies
- Source maps separated from production builds

### 6. Build Security
- Console logs removed in production builds
- Source code minification and obfuscation
- Secure asset naming with integrity hashes

## Security Configuration Files

### For Nginx
```nginx
include /path/to/sui-sign/security-headers.conf;
```

### For Apache
Add the security headers from `security-headers.conf` to your virtual host configuration.

### For Cloudflare
Most security headers can be configured through Cloudflare's dashboard under Security > Headers.

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories: [Report Vulnerability](https://github.com/AbhimanyuAjudiya/sui-sign/security/advisories/new)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure security headers on your web server
- [ ] Set up monitoring for suspicious activities
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
- [ ] Enable security logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Browser Compatibility

SuiSign is tested to work securely with:
- Chrome 90+ (with Enhanced Safe Browsing)
- Firefox 88+ (with Enhanced Tracking Protection)
- Safari 14+ (with Intelligent Tracking Prevention)
- Edge 90+ (with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen)

## Privacy Considerations

- No personal data is stored on external servers
- All document signing happens on the blockchain
- Profile pictures and user data are handled securely
- Session data is encrypted and time-limited

## Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Dependency Updates**: Automated security updates via Dependabot
2. **Code Scanning**: GitHub Advanced Security features enabled
3. **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security assessments
4. **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents
